The Wright School of Dance is a local dance school aiming to inspire children to develop confidence and learn new skills.

The site, designed in collaboration with artist Pat Lewis of [LewisCreative](http://lewiscreative.co.uk){:target="_blank"}, aims to communicate the friendly nature of the dance school. This is done through touches such as the hand-drawn signatures, bright colours, and images of the school in action. The circular images are chosen to reflect the spotlight of performance.

On the back-end, a custom miniature CMS using PHP and MySQL was designed for rapid content creation and quick page loads. The CMS console also allows administrators to manage student group membership and post reminders, instructions, and private lessons directly to the students.
