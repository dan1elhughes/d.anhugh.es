> From the outset I found Dan to be professional, innovative and extremely helpful. Dan was able to guide me expertly through the process of initial ideas to finished website. I am thrilled at the end result, the website is exactly what I needed and more. I highly recommend Dan. He's built two websites for me now and no doubt there will be a third in the future!

Before the launch event, I was contacted to design and build a single-page website to advertise the book. A simple dark colour scheme with a bright highlight was chosen to reflect the existing book design, with alternating light and dark stripes.

Before the launch date, the "Buy now button" instead showed a countdown timer in human-readable format (for example, "in three weeks"). The social media section runs as asynchronous API calls to the server, which dispatches requests to the Facebook and Twitter APIs and sends back the required information. This is then cached using Redis for near-instant loading for the next user.
